# Laissez.fit API

RESTful API for Laissez.fit Client. 

## Introduction

This app addresses the problems that arise from our modern "lazy" lifestyles. 
If we could manage to be a little more active, and a little less stressed, and
eat a little better, a little less medicated and more knowledgeable in our
approach to our health, we can lead happier, more productive lives. We can do
things we don't think possible. We can age better and live smarter and do
more by doing less. If this sounds like something for you then Laissez.fit is 
the fitness tracking and awareness app for you. 

## Usage

Tracking is a achieved by typing your data into the input fields. While a 
wearable is great here, there are metrics you can take that a wearable cannot
provide. You can input blood glucose, and blood pressure, you can input macro-
nutrients and total calories, and track your mood. There is even a place for 
you to write about whatever you like. You can only upload one value for each
input per day. However you can update those values as often as you like. So if
you want to put your calories tracked in the morning and upload changes through
the day, you can, just remember that you do have to put the whole number of 
calories consumed at the given time. If you had 400 calories in the morning, 
then 800 at lunch, you would add the two and input 1200. Also, users can add 
comments and delete their own comments.
